# Conclusions  
Overall, this project was a very good learning experience for me because I am a lot more familiar now
with the tools that can be used to create a reproducible work. The easiest part of this project was
using writing everything in Markdown. This makes sense because Markdown was intended to be as 
easy to use and read as possible and I had almost no problems with it. I did, however, have some 
challenges familiarizing myself with Git. I had very little interaction with command line before 
taking this class, so linking my local repository to my Github account was frustrating because I 
ran into an issue in between and had difficulty interpreting the error messages in command line 
to identify my problem. This also made Git configuration the most time consuming portion of the 
project for me. The process for saving changes and writing commit messages was also a little 
tedious to me in the beginning, but as I got more used to the command line system and 
navigating through Git, the commits and Github pushes became extremely easy for me. I am very 
glad to have learned all of this, because when I worked on documents or projects in the past 
and got stuck on a particular issue, I would always wish I could go back to a specific version 
of my work or wish I knew what my previous thought process was. During this project, I was able 
to use tools like my Makefile and `git log` to go through my executables and take a closer 
look at my history whenever I ran into errors. This helped reinforce my belief that the tools 
I used in this project can be very powerful in facilitating reproducibility because I was able 
see for myself how important it is to always have detailed records to refer to and have tools 
that enable easy replication of my work so that others can review my process as well. Being able 
to hand my work over to someone else and give them a clear record of what commands I executed 
in terminal or what formatting I created in Markdown was important for this project because 
I asked for help a number of times from my classmates and graduate student instructor. Their 
help was essential for the successful completion of this project because there are a few errors 
I would not have been able to resolve without their help and advice. While this project did 
take me a little more than a week and I did experience a little frustration while completing it, 
I learned some very valuable techniques in data handling and best practices for reproducibility. 
I hope to incorporate these takeaways in all my future data projects and research efforts.
