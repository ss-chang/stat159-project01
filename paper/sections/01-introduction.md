# Introduction
The motivation behind this project is to provide an example of a reproducible work. Doing this 
project will also allow me to practice how to make my code reproducible and easy to examine by 
others who may wish to examine or verify my work.

I will also provide brief explanations of each of the tools I use for this project, explaining
the usefulness and functions of each tool.

In doing this project, I hope to become more accustomed to the processes that are essential to
creating a reproducible work. I am in favor of reproducibility because it will make my research,
my statements, and my arguments in any project or paper more trustworthy to my peers and readers.
To me, reproducibility is important because it adds transparency and credibility to the analysis
and conlusions one may wish to draw out of raw data and statistics. As I begin to familiarize 
myself with the tools and best practices for reproducibility, I hope to adopt this type of
workflow into my regular approach for researhc and analysis.
