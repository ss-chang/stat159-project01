# Introduction
After incidents such as the Reinhart and Rogoff controversy and the Potti scandal, many 
researchers and academic figures have pointed to a reproducibility crisis within the 
scientific community. The mass misinformation that the Reinhart and Rogoff controversy 
sparked by tying high debt-to-GDP ratios to negative GDP growth and the death of a 
cancer patient from failing to receive proper treatment after enrolling in a clinical 
trial based on Dr. Anil Potti's fabricated and manipulated data have all pointed to 
the devastating effects that improperly vetted and mishandled data can produce. As a 
result, more and more scientists are calling for greater reproducibility in scientific 
work as a way to prove credibility in their research.  

Victoria Stodden, a renowned scholar on this subject, identified "computational 
reproducibility" in [2014](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25340) as one of the 
areas in reproducible research that need specific focus and additional effort. Stodden, 
along with a number of other authors, further elaborated in ["Setting the Default to Reproducible"](http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf) that five main facets of 
computational reproducibility entail reviewable research, replicable research, confirmable 
research, auditable research, and open or reproducible research. 

In the spirit of answering to such calls for greater reproducibility within the scientific 
community, I will work through this project to create an example of a reproducible work. My 
motivation for doing so is to demonstrate what is necessary and helpful for creating a 
reproducible work and to practice how to make my code reproducible and easily accessible for 
others who may wish to examine or verify my work.

I will also provide brief explanations of each of the tools I use for this project, explaining
the usefulness and functions of each tool.

In doing this project, I hope to become more accustomed to the processes that are essential to
creating a reproducible work. I am in favor of reproducibility because it will make my research,
my statements, and my arguments in any project or paper more trustworthy to my peers and readers.
To me, reproducibility is important because it adds transparency and credibility to the analysis
and conlusions one may wish to draw out of raw data and statistics. As I begin to familiarize 
myself with the tools and best practices for reproducibility, I hope to adopt this type of
workflow into my regular approach for research and analysis.
