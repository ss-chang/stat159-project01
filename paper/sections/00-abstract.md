# Abstract
In this paper, I will demonstrate how to compile a reproducable paper using a variety of 
computational tools on Mac OS X. Such tools include: terminal/bash, markdown, pandoc, git, 
github, Make, and Sublime Text. Bash will be used to carry out terminal commands, while git will
be used to track files and changes that I make through bash. I will use Github to host an online 
repository for my project directory and I will set it up to pull files and commits from my
local repository. Markdown is a type of file that I will write my text files in; these text
files will later be compiled into a single document to represent my entire paper. Finally, I
will use pandoc to convert my compiled markdown file into other file types, such as html.  
  
In addition to commenting on the tools used for this paper, I will also discuss areas of this 
project that I found easy, areas that I found difficult, what assistance I needed, and how much
time the overall process took me.
