### Makefiles
A Makefile is a text file that implements **make**. Make is a Unix tool that "controls the 
generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source
files." Thus, a Makefile is where we can write out what commands we want to execute through
terminal in such a way that source files can be easily transferred among different people
and a target file (e.g. compiled text, graphic, etc.) can be generated on each person's computer
without having to manually type out the required commands.  
Makefiles consist of __rules__, which tell Make what commands to execute
