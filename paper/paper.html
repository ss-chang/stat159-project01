<p>In this paper, I will demonstrate how to compile a reproducable paper using a variety of computational tools on Mac OS X. Such tools include: terminal/bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, Make, and Sublime Text. Bash will be used to carry out terminal commands, while git will be used to track in files and directories that I make through bash. Github will be where an online repository for my project directory and will be set up to pull commits and changes from my computer. Markdown is a type of file that I will write my text files in; these text files will later be compiled into a single document to represent my entire paper. Finally, I will use pandoc to convert my compiled markdown file into other file types, such as html.<br />
In addition to commenting on the tools used for this paper, I will also discuss areas of this project that I found easy, areas that I found difficult, what assistance I needed, and how much time the overall process took me.</p>
