Abstract
========

In this paper, I will demonstrate how to compile a reproducable paper
using a variety of computational tools on Mac OS X. Such tools include:
terminal/bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, Make, and Sublime Text.
Bash will be used to carry out terminal commands, while git will be used
to track in files and directories that I make through bash. Github will
be where an online repository for my project directory and will be set
up to pull commits and changes from my computer. Markdown is a type of
file that I will write my text files in; these text files will later be
compiled into a single document to represent my entire paper. Finally, I
will use pandoc to convert my compiled markdown file into other file
types, such as html.\
In addition to commenting on the tools used for this paper, I will also
discuss areas of this project that I found easy, areas that I found
difficult, what assistance I needed, and how much time the overall
process took me.
